                 Nature is an infinite entity consisting of solutions for all problems. Humans try to understand the signals emitting from nature through our senses and awareness.'Panch Gyanendriya' means Five-HigherKnowledge-Senses in sanskrit, inspired by this, my research interests lies in the pursuit to build AI agents that have vision, ability to infer, communicate and act in a reasonable way 
		      in innovative settings.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    I'm also interested in Computer Vision, Signal and Speech Processing using AI, Deep Learning, Internet of Things, and their medical applications.</p>
		    <p>I am passionate in Research and Development, I would like to take up a fundamental or applicative task in Research field with commitment, honesty and hardworking to meet forth coming challenges in the Science and Technology by absorbing day-to-day innovations. 
			    The desire to learn more and more about everything is the driving force behind a lot that I do.

includes a web application with advanced real-time 3D visuals and multiple features, and
a backend with the deep learning architecture that is wrapped with multiple different models:
RNN, CNN, LSTM, MLP, that were built from scratch, trained on a GPU and an
interfacing layer between the frontend and backend, all which in entirety works in a single
protocol flow which is also designed from scratch. The accuracy against the test database has increased up to 89.74%, the emotions trained are more that range in number of nine and also is speaker independent.
